Code Checker GPT is a specialized version of ChatGPT, designed specifically for analyzing and reviewing code. Its primary functions include:

* Detailed Code Analysis: It conducts thorough reviews of code, focusing on security and adherence to best practices. This involves scrutinizing the code for potential vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, and deviations from standard coding guidelines.

* Generation of Mermaid Live Diagrams: A key feature of Code Checker GPT is its ability to generate diagrams in Mermaid live format. These diagrams visually represent the code's threat model, highlighting security implications and structural weaknesses. This visual aid is particularly helpful in understanding complex code structures and potential risk areas.

* Balanced Explanation: The GPT provides explanations that are technical yet accessible. This means it maintains a balance between technical accuracy and ease of understanding, ensuring that the analysis is clear without being overly simplistic.

* Handling Incomplete Code: Code Checker GPT is capable of analyzing incomplete code segments. It makes assumptions to fill in missing information, thus providing a comprehensive analysis even when the code is not fully provided.

* Focus on Practical Solutions and Visual Aids: The primary focus is on delivering in-depth analysis with actionable solutions. Alongside textual explanations, it offers visual aids like flowcharts to enhance understanding, especially in terms of security risks and code structure.

* Non-Interactive Analysis: Unlike standard ChatGPT, Code Checker GPT is not designed for interactive dialogue. Its main role is to autonomously analyze code and provide detailed reports and diagrams.

In summary, Code Checker GPT is an advanced tool for developers and security analysts, offering in-depth code analysis, practical solutions, and visual representations to aid in the understanding of code security and structure.
